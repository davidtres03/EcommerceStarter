## Patch Release - Auto-Update Fix

This patch release fixes the auto-update system failing to find installer packages in GitHub releases.

### Fixed
- Auto-Update Package Detection - Fixed upgrader failing to find installer package
  - Updated asset filename pattern matching to support EcommerceStarter-v*.zip format
  - Added fallback patterns for legacy naming conventions
  - Resolves Package Not Found error when attempting in-place upgrades from maintenance mode

### Technical Details
The maintenance mode upgrader was looking for EcommerceStarter-Installer-*.zip but releases use EcommerceStarter-v*.zip naming. Updated pattern matching with multiple fallback patterns for compatibility.

### Upgrade from v1.0.0 or v1.0.1
Download and install v1.0.2, or use the auto-update system which now works correctly.
