## Fixed
- **Auto-Update System** - Fixed upgrader executable not found in package
  - Changed MaintenanceModePage to use `EcommerceStarter.Installer.exe` for upgrades (already included in package)
  - Installer.exe now handles in-place upgrades directly from downloaded package
  - Added fallback path detection for legacy package structures
  - Resolves "Upgrader Not Found" error after successful package download

## Technical Details
The v1.0.0-1.0.2 packages did not include the separate Upgrader.exe, causing in-place upgrades to fail. This version simplifies the architecture by using the main Installer.exe (which is always present in the package) to perform upgrades. The installer accepts the same command-line arguments and provides identical upgrade functionality.
